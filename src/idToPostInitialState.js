That process is in the works, though everyone is looking for work right now thanks to the __COVID__ craziness we’ve all been swept into.

      "Near the end of coding boot camp, we were giving Lightning Talks in class. They’re five to seven-minute presentations about a technology/library/what-have-you. Everyone had prepared to answer questions. One of my classmates didn’t ask for questions. Instead, he said: “I’d like to leave the floor open for questions, but you’re Engineers so just read the docs first.” We all laughed and cheered the chutzpah to say such a thing… then today happened and I am laughing at myself humbled and hopefully wiser.\n\n\nI had mentioned before that I was working on a takehome project for a job interview. Well, I thought that I was doing my due diligence by diving into research online about the libraries that were new to me that I was asked to use (Redux-Saga, Reselect). I downloaded the app template (React Boilerplate) and started trying to write code to match the patterns I saw in YouTube tutorials.\n\nI write code with VS Code and searched for one of the methods I had used, only to see it was popping up in other files that I hadn’t touched yet. Was it possible this boilerplate had these libraries built into it already? Yup. And guess what? There was a folder of doc files describing how to use the libraries with links to the resources. If only I had read the docs, it would have saved me some time.\n\nJust now I put a little time on my side project: the CoverLetterMaker() app. After the first two days, I was hitting a wall. I’m writing a Node.js app that accesses my local file system, so using the fs library made sense. I was able to read and log a file in a given folder using fs.readFile(). The next step is to save each file to a variable. I was blocked the other night when fs.readFile() would return undefined. Guess who read the docs on fs.readFile() and realized that it’s an async function? This guy!\n\nSidebar for those that don’t code. What’s an async function? I think of functions as recipe instructions. Functions are steps taken to an expected output that can be reused or repeated. You can reuse the same recipe for your Sunday morning waffles. In most cases, code is synchronous: it does not move on to the next step until the last one is complete. Async is “asynchronous.” That’s like when you’re baking and you see the first step is to preheat the oven. You don’t turn on the oven, sit and wait for it to reach the temperature, and then start mixing ingredients. Instead, you crank the oven and do the rest of the recipe.\n\nBack to the CoverLetterMaker() story. When I read the docs on fs.readFile() it realized that it didn’t return the data from the file it was reading. The file was just sitting there after having been read, like a coffee table book no one bothers to commit any of the contents to their own memory. However, readfileAsync() returns the value. So I can now save the files to variables and move forward on this side project… but tomorrow. It’s getting late.\n\nThe moral of these stories is this: read the docs. Don’t start looking everywhere else for the answers before you familiarize yourself with the basics. Sometimes they’re baked right in.",

    description: "excerpt from loremipsum.com",
    body:
      'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.',
