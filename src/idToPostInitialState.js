      "Years ago, I fell in love with a career. Every day I went to work excited to do and learn more about the industry. With so many different sources of information and a wide variety of styles to dive deep into it was a learner's paradise. I'd leave work and spend my nights at home experimenting with a small idea until the late hours of the night. Then I found out what it was that was exciting about this industry. I thrived on solving problems. I loved finding new ways to accomplish anything in the Restaurant Industry, but it turned out I loved solving problems anywhere! \n\n I started a job at a worker-owned collective and enjoyed collaborating with others to solve the problems of a growing company. The day came when I found a problem I thought could be solved with programming: produce orders. I assumed it simple to write a script to estimate how much pizza we'd sell on a given day. We had years of sales reports that I could use as data points. This is when I decided to start learning Python. \n\n At 5 o'clock every morning I would get up to make a pot of coffee and watch my Udemy course at the kitchen table. One morning I realized that I'm doing exactly what I used to do with cooking: learning to problem solve.",

    body: "Near the end of coding boot camp, we gave Lightning Talks in class. They’re short presentations about a technology/library that we've been working with. Everyone prepared to answer questions. One of my classmates didn’t ask for questions. Instead, he said, “I’d like to leave the floor open for questions, but you’re Engineers so just read the docs first.” We all laughed and cheered the chutzpah to say such a thing. Then today happened and I am laughing at myself humbled and hopefully wiser. Today I dove deep into StackOverflow, old notes, and a bag of potato chips to discover three things. Typos, a YouTube video of the original Japanese Red Power Ranger at a comic book convention, and that my problem was explained in the docs. Save yourself some heartache, look your code over for typos and linter squiggly lines, and read visit the docs for whatever libraries you use.",

    description: "excerpt from loremipsum.com",
    body:
      'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhy do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.',
